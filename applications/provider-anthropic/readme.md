## Anthropic Does Not Offer Embedding Models

From the [docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/build-with-claude/embeddings):

> Anthropic does not offer its own embedding model. One embeddings provider that has a wide variety of options and capabilities is Voyage AI.

Embedding-dependent demos (vector stores, RAG) require a separate embedding provider or won't work with Anthropic alone.
