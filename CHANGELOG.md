# Changelog — Spring AI Zero-to-Hero Workshop

## [2.3.2] - 2026-04-19

### Added
- Dockerized Ollama as an optional, first-class alternative to a host install. New `docker/ollama/docker-compose.yaml` (CPU default) + `docker-compose.gpu.yaml` overlay for NVIDIA. Mounts `models/ollama/` into the container; same port 11434 so `provider-ollama` config is unchanged.
- `models/ollama.sh import` target chooser: `--target=ollama` (native, tarball), `--target=docker` (dockerized models dir, tarball), `--target=docker-pull` (runs `docker exec ollama ollama pull` for every `WORKSHOP_MODELS` entry). Interactive prompt offers all three.
- `models/containers.sh` `--with-ollama` flag and opt-in prompt for `ollama/ollama:latest` (~1.3 GB).
- `workshop.sh`: new `infra ollama` target, new `--ollama-docker` flag on `start`, new `[3/4]` optional step in `setup` for the Ollama image, and a three-state runtime indicator (`ollama:docker` / `ollama:local` / `ollama:off`) in the menu header and `status` output.
- `docs/ollama_dockerized.md` — canonical reference with performance notes (macOS CPU-only, x86 vs arm64, NVIDIA overlay), airgapped workflow, and commands.

### Changed
- `cmd_stop` now includes the dockerized Ollama in its single "stop Docker containers?" prompt when the container is up.
- `cmd_check` and `cmd_status` distinguish native vs dockerized Ollama and surface actionable hints when neither is running.
- `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, `docs/guide.md`, `docs/providers.md`, `docs/troubleshooting.md` — cross-referenced to the new doc; quickstart gains a Section 3.5 airgapped recipe; troubleshooting gains three new entries.

### Notes
- macOS containers cannot access Metal — native `Ollama.app` remains preferred on Apple Silicon for performance. The dockerized path targets attendees without a local install and airgapped environments.

## [2.3.1] - 2026-04-18

### Added
- Stage 7 dashboard UI at `/dashboard/stage/7` — two cards (Inner Monologue, Model-Directed Loop) with inline chat consoles, multi-step trace rendering, provider pills, live curl lines.
- Ollama support for Stage 7 agents alongside OpenAI — one jar per agent, Spring profile selects provider.
- `./workshop.sh agentic start|stop|status|logs` subcommand family managing agent apps on ports `:8091`/`:8092`.
- Fallback handler in both agents for weak local models: wraps free-form / malformed responses with `[fallback: model replied without tool]` marker. Demo 02 forces `requestReinvocation=false` on fallback to stop the loop cleanly.
- Gateway spy routing for Ollama: `ollama,spy` profile combo now actively routes through `:7777/ollama` (the gateway route pre-existed in `RouteConfig.java`).
- New agent REST endpoints: `POST /{id}/reset` and `GET /{id}/log` for memory management and history inspection.
- `WHATS_NEW_STAGE_07_AGENTIC.md` attendee + trainer walkthrough.
- Stage 7 troubleshooting section in `docs/troubleshooting.md`.

### Changed
- `docs/spring-ai/SPRING_AI_STAGE_7.md` — added dashboard endpoint inventory, Ollama model compatibility matrix (incl. `llava` counter-example), fallback behavior anchor, observability + gateway spy notes.
- `agentic-system/*/readme.md` — "New in Stage 7 UI" intro boxes.
- `docs/guide.md` — Stage 7 section with `workshop.sh agentic` commands.

### Fixed
- Stage 7 fullscreen console — long pasted prompts no longer push the **Send** button out of view. The message form uses CSS Grid (`minmax(0, 1fr) auto`) and the center column is explicitly constrained with `grid-template-columns: minmax(0, 1fr)`, so a large textarea value wraps internally instead of blowing the column out.
- Stage 7 fullscreen exit — topbar icons (theme toggle, provider/profile pills, UI entry) re-enter the viewport. JS now remembers `window.scrollY` on fullscreen enter and restores it on exit, so the page no longer sits at a stale scroll offset after the fixed-positioned console returns to normal flow.

### Breaking
- Removed `inner-monologue-agent` and `model-directed-loop-agent` dependencies from `applications/provider-openai/pom.xml` (commit `c0759a6`) — Stage 7 agents now exclusively run as **standalone Spring Boot processes** on `:8091`/`:8092`, launched via `./workshop.sh agentic start all`. The legacy "all-in-one on :8080" mode (where the agent REST controllers were served from the provider app's JVM) is no longer supported. The dashboard at `:8080` proxies to the standalone agents over HTTP.

## [2.3.0] — 2026-04-17: Stage 6 MCP Dashboard UI & Coordinated Lifecycle

Stage 6 (Model Context Protocol) moves from CLI-only to a first-class dashboard chapter. Every MCP demo is now runnable, inspectable, and invokable from `http://localhost:8080/dashboard/stage/6`, backed by a new `./workshop.sh mcp` command family that manages the five demos' lifecycle from a single script.

> 👉 **Attendee + trainer walkthrough:** [`WHATS_NEW_STAGE_06_MCP.md`](WHATS_NEW_STAGE_06_MCP.md) — recommended demo order, time budget, trainer notes, and troubleshooting.
>
> **Deep-dive reference:** [`docs/spring-ai/SPRING_AI_STAGE_6.md`](docs/spring-ai/SPRING_AI_STAGE_6.md) — per-demo flow diagrams, key code, MCP JSON-RPC endpoints, and curl equivalents.

### Dashboard — Stage 6 page

- **New `/dashboard/stage/6`** with five demo cards (01 STDIO, 02 HTTP, 03 Client, 04 Dynamic, 05 Full Capabilities). Live status pills poll every 3 seconds via a TCP port probe (not actuator health — 04's `CountDownLatch` blocks health readiness).
- **Tool inspection modal** (Bootstrap-5, styled after the stages 1–5 gateway modal) opens from each card's **List tools** button. Each tool renders as a card with collapsible input schema and an **Invoke** button that expands a schema-driven argument form.
- **Per-tool Invoke form** builds a live curl line below the submit button that updates as you type; one-click copy to clipboard, same UX as stages 1–5.
- **Resource inspection** (05 only) merges `resources/list` + `resources/templates/list` into one list with `resource`/`template` badges, pre-fills each URI, and offers a **Read** button with live curl.
- **Prompt inspection** (05 only) renders per-prompt argument forms with typed inputs, `@McpArg` descriptions as visible helper text, and live curl.
- **Demo 03 Run** renders the LLM response as chat bubbles (user question → assistant answer with markdown rendering) and a `tools from: 01+02` badge indicating which MCP servers contributed tools. Raw envelope available via a `Raw response` collapsible.
- **Demo 04 Dynamic registration** trigger button with a one-shot-latch-aware UX; list-tools re-invocation after registration shows the new math tools in a fresh modal.
- **Docs button on every card** opens the corresponding Demo section of `SPRING_AI_STAGE_6.md` in a modal, with Mermaid diagrams rendered client-side (matching the stages 1–5 docs modal).

### Backend — `components/config-dashboard/src/main/java/com/example/dashboard/mcp/`

- **`McpDemoCatalog`** — static catalog of the five demos with id, title, one-liner, transport, port, module path, capabilities enum.
- **`McpClientRegistry`** — long-lived `McpSyncClient` cache for 02/04/05, connected via `HttpClientStreamableHttpTransport` (Streamable HTTP — **no SSE** anywhere in this codebase). TCP port probe for `isUp`. Graceful eviction on errors; `@PreDestroy` closes all connections.
- **`McpStdioInvoker`** — per-request subprocess spawn for 01 STDIO using `StdioClientTransport(ServerParameters, McpJsonDefaults.getMapper())`. Jar path resolved by walking up from the JVM cwd so the provider app (running from its module dir) still finds `mcp/01-mcp-stdio-server/target/*.jar`. Caller-managed `openClient()` API for multi-step flows (e.g. holding the STDIO client open across a ChatClient call).
- **`McpInspectorController`** — REST endpoints under `/dashboard/mcp/`:
  - `GET /{id}/status` — status + port + capabilities + transport + startCommand hint
  - `GET /{id}/tools` — list tools (routes 01 → StdioInvoker, others → ClientRegistry)
  - `POST /{id}/invoke` — call a tool with JSON args
  - `GET /{id}/resources` — **merges** `listResources()` + `listResourceTemplates()`
  - `GET /{id}/resources/read?uri=…` — read a specific resource
  - `GET /{id}/prompts` — list prompts
  - `POST /{id}/prompts/get` — get a prompt with args
  - `POST /04/update-tools` — proxy to 04's `/updateTools` with cache reset
  - `POST /03/run?mode=local` — build `SyncMcpToolCallbackProvider` on-demand from live 01+02 clients (with `DefaultMcpToolNamePrefixGenerator` to disambiguate duplicate tool names); external mode returns 400 pointing at the CLI
- **Unit tests** — 23 new tests across `McpDemoCatalogTest`, `McpClientRegistryTest`, `McpStdioInvokerTest`, `McpInspectorControllerTest`, `McpDemoTest`.

### `workshop.sh` — coordinated MCP lifecycle

```bash
./workshop.sh mcp start all          # build 01 jar + start 02/04/05
./workshop.sh mcp start 02           # start just 02
./workshop.sh mcp status             # table: id | port | pid | up?
./workshop.sh mcp logs 04            # tail 04's log
./workshop.sh mcp stop all           # stop them cleanly
./workshop.sh mcp build-01           # build the STDIO jar
```

- PID + log files under `.workshop/mcp/` (gitignored).
- Per-demo port probing via `nc -z`/`/dev/tcp` (not `/actuator/health` — works around 04's latch).
- Process-group kill with `lsof -ti:<port> | xargs kill -9` fallback so Maven's forked JVM children are reaped cleanly.
- Exit codes propagate correctly for CI use (invalid id → exit 1).
- **Interactive TUI menu items 11–14** (Start MCP demo / Stop MCP demo / MCP status / Tail MCP logs) added to `draw_menu`.
- **Status banner** (`services_status_line`) now shows `MCP: 02✓ 04✗ 05✓` alongside provider / spy / ui / pg / lgtm.
- **Bash 3.2 compat preserved** — macOS bash 3.2 doesn't support `declare -A`, so lookups use case-helpers (`mcp_port_for`, `mcp_module_for`, `mcp_label_for`).

### MCP module changes

- **Module renames** (to match the canonical doc and remove the redundant "basic" word):
  - `mcp/01-basic-stdio-mcp-server/` → `mcp/01-mcp-stdio-server/`
  - `mcp/02-basic-http-mcp-server/` → `mcp/02-mcp-http-server/`
  - `mcp/03-basic-mcp-client/` → `mcp/03-mcp-client/`
  - 04, 05 dir names unchanged
  - Artifact IDs and parent pom module list updated in lockstep
- **Port allocation** — HTTP demos pinned to distinct ports: 02 → `:8081`, 04 → `:8082`, 05 → `:8083`. Each exposes `/actuator/health` (new `spring-boot-starter-actuator` dependency).
- **04 client URL fix** — `http://localhost:8080/updateTools` → `http://localhost:8082/updateTools` so the demo client actually reaches its paired server instead of the provider app.
- **01/02 weather tool rework** — `getTemperature` now accepts city OR coordinates (or both). Missing args no longer NPE; city-only path geocodes via Open-Meteo before fetching the forecast. Returns a `TemperatureResult` record; not-found cases return a friendly `note` field instead of throwing.
- **04/05 tool parameters annotated** — every `@Tool` method has `@ToolParam` descriptions with concrete examples. `getAlerts` parameter description enumerates all 50 US state codes + DC + PR. 04's `MathTools` has example invocations per tool.
- **05 resources, prompts annotated** — `@McpResource` descriptions list known demo usernames (`john`, `jane`, `bob`, `alice`); `@McpArg` descriptions on every prompt argument carry example values.

### Demo 03 — dual-config refactor

- Extracted `McpClientDemoRunner` bean from the inline `CommandLineRunner`; CLI now delegates, dashboard's `/03/run` uses its own path.
- `mcp-servers-config.json` split into `mcp-servers-local.json` (01 STDIO jar + 02 HTTP) and `mcp-servers-external.json` (Brave Search + filesystem via `npx`).
- `application.yaml` split into default (local) + `mcp-external` profile.
- Local mode is the default and closes the 01→02→03 pedagogical arc; external mode preserved for attendees who want the full MCP ecosystem experience.

### Dashboard backend dependency

- `spring-ai-starter-mcp-client` is now a non-optional dependency of `components/config-dashboard`. Optional blocked `spring-ai-mcp` (home of `SyncMcpToolCallbackProvider`) from transitively reaching provider apps, which broke `/03/run` at runtime. Making it required propagates the client starter to every provider app; the MCP client autoconfig is a no-op when no connections are configured.
- `spring-boot-webmvc-test` added (Spring Boot 4 moved `@WebMvcTest` to this artifact; no longer transitive via `spring-boot-starter-test`).

### Documentation

- **New root-level [`WHATS_NEW_STAGE_06_MCP.md`](WHATS_NEW_STAGE_06_MCP.md)** — 7-step walkthrough, time budget, trainer notes, FAQ, and implementation highlights. Linked from `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/spring-ai/README.md`, `docs/guide.md`, and `docs/spring-ai/SPRING_AI_STAGE_6.md`.
- **Rewritten [`docs/spring-ai/SPRING_AI_STAGE_6.md`](docs/spring-ai/SPRING_AI_STAGE_6.md)** — UI + CLI workflows, port allocation table, dashboard endpoint bullets per demo, curl equivalents under each Demo, Demo 05 resource catalog (9 URI templates), MCP JSON-RPC server-endpoint table, concrete-vs-template explainer, dual-config section for 03, spy-gateway exclusion note.
- **Rewritten Stage 6 section in [`docs/guide.md`](docs/guide.md)** — dashboard as primary entry point, `./workshop.sh mcp` commands as canonical, module table with new dir names + ports, walkthrough link.
- **"New in Stage 6 UI" intro boxes** on every `mcp/*/README.md` pointing at the dashboard page.
- **Minor wording appends** on `README.md`, `docs/README.md`, `docs/spring-ai/README.md`, `docs/spring-ai/SPRING_AI_INTRODUCTION.md`, and `CLAUDE.md` to reflect the UI integration + directory renames.
- **New "Stage 6 / MCP" troubleshooting section** in `docs/troubleshooting.md` (port in use, workshop.sh mcp start timeouts, dashboard offline, 01 jar missing, 04 one-shot latch).

### Design doc & plan

Captured on branch for auditability (gitignored from main per workshop convention):

- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-04-17-stage6-mcp-enhancement-design.md`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-04-17-stage6-mcp-enhancement.md`

## [2.2.2] — 2026-04-15: Dashboard Light/Dark Mode Toggle

Adds a persistent theme toggle to the workshop dashboard topbar, available on every page (overview + all stage detail pages).

### Dashboard Theme Toggle

- **Sun/moon button in the topbar** — switches between the existing dark theme (default) and a new light theme on click
- **Persistent preference** — `localStorage` key `theme` stores the user's choice; survives refreshes and browser restarts with no expiration
- **Flash prevention** — `theme.js` runs as an IIFE in `<head>` before first paint, reading `localStorage` synchronously so the correct theme renders from the initial page load
- **Light theme uses darker green tones** (`#3d7a1c`) for WCAG AA contrast against the light background
- **Highlight.js colors** adapted to a GitHub-style palette when light mode is active
- **Smooth 200ms transitions** between themes, disabled on initial page load to avoid a flash animation
- **Mermaid diagrams re-render** with matching theme on toggle — existing diagrams have their original markdown restored and re-processed
- **Bootstrap `data-bs-theme` kept in sync** so form controls, close buttons, and other Bootstrap components follow the theme automatically

### CSS Architecture Refactor

- **50+ CSS custom properties** defined in `:root`, with `[data-theme="light"]` overrides — covers all UI colors, JSON syntax highlighting, highlight.js tokens, code blocks, modals, gateway panel, and component-specific elements
- **All hardcoded color literals removed** from stylesheets and templates in favour of theme-aware `var(--spring-*)` references
- **Bootstrap `text-light` utility replaced** with `var(--spring-text)` inline styles on endpoint paths, stage card titles, doc modal title, similarity labels, and card values
- **`btn-close-white` removed** from gateway modal — Bootstrap's `data-bs-theme` now handles close-button contrast

### Files

- New: `components/config-dashboard/src/main/resources/static/js/theme.js` (toggle logic, persistence, Mermaid re-init)
- Modified: `workshop.css` (+200 lines: variables + light overrides + toggle button + transitions)
- Modified: `layout.html` (theme.js in `<head>`, toggle button in topbar, dynamic Mermaid theme init)
- Modified: `response.js` (theme-aware error bubbles and dynamic HTML)
- Modified: `stage/detail.html`, `dashboard/index.html` (theme-aware text + modal close styling)

## [2.2.1] — 2026-04-11: Anthropic Provider Fix & Gateway Spy UI Improvements

Bug fixes for the Anthropic provider and visual improvements to the gateway spy panel in the workshop dashboard.

### Bug Fixes

- **Anthropic provider startup failure** — Added `spring-boot-restclient` dependency. In Spring Boot 4, `RestClient.Builder` auto-configuration moved to a separate module; the Anthropic SDK (OkHttp-based) doesn't pull it in transitively unlike OpenAI/Ollama starters
- **Gateway routing all requests to Ollama** — In Spring Cloud Gateway MVC 5.x, `.before(uri())` filters apply to all routes in a builder group, not just the preceding route. The last `uri()` (Ollama) always won. Replaced with a single route using dynamic URI selection based on request path
- **Anthropic provider name showing "unknown"** — Added `spring.application.name: provider-anthropic` to application config

### Dashboard Improvements

- **Gateway spy JSON syntax highlighting** — Color-coded JSON output: green keys, blue strings, yellow numbers, red booleans, gray nulls
- **Nested JSON expansion** — Tool call arguments and tool results (escaped JSON strings) are expanded into formatted objects
- **Newline handling** — `\n` sequences unescaped for readability, trailing newlines stripped
- **Always-visible scrollbar** — Gateway request/response panels show vertical scrollbar when content overflows
- **Fullscreen expand modal** — New expand icon (⤢) on the gateway panel opens a side-by-side request/response modal for easier inspection of large payloads
- **Provider and profiles in stage topbar** — Stage detail pages now show the provider name and active profiles (matching the dashboard overview)

---

## [2.2.0] — 2026-04-10: Enhanced Observability & Offline Workshop Tools

End-to-end distributed tracing with per-span log correlation in Grafana, and offline workshop tooling for slow-WiFi venues.

### Observability

- **Endpoint payload logging** — `ControllerTracingAspect` logs request params/body and truncated response at INFO level, auto-correlated to OTel traces in Loki
- **Distributed tracing through spy gateway** — Added `spring-boot-starter-opentelemetry`, `observation` profile, and `logback-spring.xml` to gateway module. Full end-to-end traces (backend → gateway → AI provider) visible in Grafana Tempo with `spy,observation` profiles
- **Per-span log correlation** — New `SpanLoggingObservationHandler` emits INFO logs for Spring AI chat observations (`AI CALL START/END`) and HTTP client observations (`HTTP CLIENT REQUEST/RESPONSE`), ensuring every span has associated logs
- **Structured gateway audit logs** — Refactored `OpenAiAuditor` to emit separate `GATEWAY REQUEST` / `GATEWAY RESPONSE` log lines with truncated payloads, replacing one large concatenated string
- **Grafana trace-to-logs fix** — Changed datasource query from `|=` (line content filter) to `| trace_id =` (structured metadata filter) for correct OTLP log correlation
- **Application name in console logs** — Added `<springProperty>` for app name in logback patterns (`[gateway]`, `[ollama]`) so interleaved logs are distinguishable
- **Gateway OTel logback installer** — Added `OpenTelemetryLogbackInstaller` so gateway logs reach Loki via OTLP export

### Workshop Tools

- **Docker image export/import** — New `models/containers.sh` script: export/import/pull/list for all 4 workshop Docker images (pgvector, pgAdmin, Grafana LGTM, MailDev). Produces `containers.tar.gz` for USB stick distribution
- **Gateway auto-starts with observation** — `workshop.sh` passes `observation` profile to gateway when selected
- **Prerequisites update** — Added prominent "Important — Before Joining the Workshop" section with all Docker and Ollama pull commands
- **Offline setup docs** — USB stick import instructions with links to `containers.sh` and `ollama.sh`

## [2.1.0] — 2026-04-04: Workshop Helpers, Dashboard UI & Docs

Workshop improvements for presenters and self-learners: interactive dashboard, OpenAPI docs, unified CLI script, and restructured documentation.

### New Modules

#### `components/config-openapi` — Swagger UI & OpenAPI Specs
- SpringDoc OpenAPI 3.0.1 with `@OpenAPIDefinition` for 5 workshop stage tags
- OpenAPI annotations on all 21 controllers (37 endpoints documented)
- Server-side path sorting for correct endpoint ordering
- Always active — Swagger UI at `/swagger-ui.html`, OpenAPI spec at `/v3/api-docs`

#### `components/config-dashboard` — Workshop Dashboard UI
- Thymeleaf + Bootstrap 5.3.3 (dark theme) + htmx 2.0.4
- Activated with `ui` profile, served at `/dashboard`
- Spring-branded dark theme with collapsible sidebar
- All frontend assets vendored locally for offline workshop use
- Auto-discovers endpoints from OpenAPI spec at runtime
- Specialized response views: plain text, JSON viewer, streaming text, similarity bar charts, chat bubbles, step accordion
- Parameter inputs with placeholder examples, dropdown selects for enum params
- Copy-to-clipboard curl command with live parameter updates
- Chat-style conversation view for Stage 4 (patterns) endpoints
- Dashboard excluded from tracing via `ObservationPredicate`

### `workshop.sh` — Unified CLI Script
- Replaces `check-deps.sh` and `download-deps.sh`
- CLI mode: `check`, `setup`, `start`, `stop`, `reset`, `status`, `logs`, `infra`
- Interactive TUI menu with provider selection and profile toggling
- Infrastructure submenu: start PostgreSQL, LGTM, or both
- Abort option (`a`) in all submenus
- Database reset: drops and recreates public schema in all 3 databases
- Port 8080 check before starting (lsof on macOS, ss on Linux)
- Process group kill on stop (Maven + forked Java)
- Runs `mvn install` before `spring-boot:run` for module dependency resolution
- Health check via `/v3/api-docs` fallback (not all providers have actuator)
- Compatible with macOS bash 3.2 and Linux bash 4+

### Documentation Restructure
- `docs/README.md` — landing page with audience routing
- `docs/quickstart.md` — 5-minute setup for live workshop attendees
- `docs/guide.md` — full 8-stage walkthrough for self-learners
- `docs/providers.md` — provider comparison, credentials, model requirements
- `docs/troubleshooting.md` — common issues and solutions
- Fixed all example docs (`examples_chat.md`, `examples_embedding.md`, `examples_image.md`, `examples_audio.md`) with correct URLs
- Root `README.md` updated with screenshots, docs links, and workshop.sh instructions

### Observability Fixes
- Suppressed generic `http.server.requests` spans — `@TracedEndpoint` spans are now root spans
- Trace root span names show HTTP request path (e.g., `GET /rag/02/query`)
- Fixed Grafana LGTM datasource provisioning for trace-to-log correlation
- Enabled OTel logging export with explicit `enabled: true`

### MCP Fixes (Stage 6)
- Added `protocol: STREAMABLE` and `streamable-http.mcp-endpoint: /mcp` to MCP 02, 04, 05
- Without this config, the Streamable HTTP transport didn't register the `/mcp` endpoint
- All 4 MCP servers tested and passing

### Agentic Fixes (Stage 7)
- Fixed model-directed-loop agent reinvocation loop: first call sent user message but discarded result, then loop sent empty prompts. Now sends user message in first iteration
- Both agents tested with OpenAI and passing

### Endpoint Fixes
- `/embed/01/dimension` — shows provider, model name, and dimensions
- `/embed/01/text` — added `text` request parameter
- `/embed/03/big` — added `size` parameter (small/large dropdown)
- `/chat/02/*/threeJokes` — makes 3 separate API calls (not 1)
- `/chat/05/dayOfWeek` — system prompt forces tool call; TimeTools returns day-of-week
- `/chat/07/explain` — fixed OpenAPI example to match actual image
- `/cot/bio/oneshot` — removed unused `message` parameter
- Fixed Ollama Flyway migration dimension: 1024 → 768
- Removed duplicate `spring-boot-starter-actuator` from provider-openai
- Hidden `/login` endpoint from OpenAPI via `springdoc.paths-to-exclude`

- **Spring Cloud Gateway 5**: `spring-cloud-starter-gateway-mvc` → `spring-cloud-starter-gateway-server-webmvc`, `HandlerFunctions.http(url)` → `http()` + `uri()` filter
- **Spring Shell 4**: `@CommandScan` → `@EnableCommand`, `@Command(command=)` → `@Command(name=)`, `PromptProvider` removed
- **AutoConfiguration packages moved**: `o.s.b.autoconfigure.jdbc` → `o.s.b.jdbc.autoconfigure`, `o.s.b.autoconfigure.flyway` → `o.s.b.flyway.autoconfigure`
- **Micrometer 1.16 metric names**: `_seconds` → `_milliseconds` throughout
- **`spring-boot-starter-aop` removed**: explicit `spring-aop` + `aspectjweaver` dependencies needed
- **`@MockBean` → `@MockitoBean`**, `@SpyBean` → `@MockitoSpyBean`

#### Spring AI 2.0
- **MCP SSE → Streamable HTTP**: `spring-ai-starter-mcp-server-webflux` → `webmvc`, `WebFluxSseClientTransport` → `HttpClientStreamableHttpTransport`
- **MCP annotations**: `com.logaritex.mcp.annotation` → `org.springframework.ai.mcp.annotation`
- **`SpringAiMcpAnnotationProvider`** → `SyncMcpAnnotationProviders` (different API: `resourceSpecifications()`, `promptSpecifications()`, `completeSpecifications()`)
- **`McpSyncClientCustomizer`** → `McpClientCustomizer<B>` (generic)
- **Google provider**: `spring-ai-starter-model-vertex-ai-gemini` → `spring-ai-starter-model-google-genai`
- **Deprecated `functions` config**: `spring.ai.openai.chat.options.functions` removed — tools registered inline via `.tools()`
- **`StdioClientTransport`** now requires `McpJsonMapper` parameter
- **MCP bean name conflicts**: Spring AI 2.0 auto-config creates `resourceSpecs`/`promptSpecs`/`completionSpecs` beans — manual beans need unique names
- **`LocalDate`/`LocalTime` in tool params**: Jackson 3 can't deserialize — use `String` instead
- **`returnDirect=true` + `entity()`**: incompatible in Spring AI 2.0 — use `.content()` with manual JSON parsing

### Fixes Applied

#### Embedding & Vector Store
- Switched default embedding model to `nomic-embed-text` (8192 token context vs 512, **768 dimensions**)
- pgvector dimension changed from 1024 → **768** in `application.yaml`
- Added `TokenTextSplitter` chunking before `vectorStore.add()` in vector store and RAG controllers
- Result: 25 bike documents → 72 chunks, all load and query successfully
- **Note:** If upgrading from an existing database with 1024-dimension vectors, drop the `vector_store` table before starting (Spring AI recreates it automatically)

#### Chat Endpoints
- Switched default chat model to `qwen3` (8B) — reliable structured output (POJO/Map), tool calling, and reasoning
- Fixed `chat_04/map` prompt to explicitly request JSON object structure
- Fixed `chat_05/search`: `LocalDate` → `String` params, `.content()` + manual JSON parsing for `returnDirect`
- Fixed `chat_07/explain`: auto-switches to `llava` model when running on Ollama

#### Observability
- Created `logback-spring.xml` with OTel Logback appender for both provider apps
- Fixed `management.tracing.export.enabled` → `management.tracing.enabled` (correct property for Spring Boot 4)
- Added `logging.level.com.example.tracing: DEBUG` for tracing aspect logs
- All Grafana dashboards updated for Micrometer 1.16 metric names (`_seconds` → `_milliseconds`)
- Fixed PromQL syntax: `metric/1000{labels}` → `metric{labels}/1000`
- Replaced Tomcat thread metrics with JVM thread metrics (Tomcat metrics not available via OTLP)
- Added `or vector(0)` fallback for error count panels (show 0 instead of N/A)

#### MCP
- Migrated 3 MCP modules from SSE to Streamable HTTP transport
- Updated MCP annotations from external `com.logaritex.mcp` to Spring AI built-in
- Fixed `StdioClientTransport` constructor for MCP SDK 1.1

#### Infrastructure
- Created sample `Profile.pdf` for chain-of-thought and self-reflection demos
- Replaced `check-deps.sh` and `download-deps.sh` with unified `workshop.sh` (see [2.1.0] below)
- Cleaned up 11 obsolete observability config files

### Test Results

| Provider | Pass | Total | Notes |
|----------|:----:|:-----:|-------|
| **Ollama** (qwen3 + nomic-embed-text) | 44 | 44 | All chat + embedding + vector + patterns + agents |
| **OpenAI** (gpt-4o-mini) | 44 | 44 | All endpoints |
| **Anthropic** (Claude, direct API) | 14 | 14 | All chat endpoints (no embeddings — Anthropic doesn't offer them) |
| **AWS Bedrock** (Amazon Nova Lite, eu-central-1) | 8 | 8 | Chat + stuff-the-prompt (no embeddings — Converse starter is chat-only) |
| **Google** (Gemini 2.5 Flash) | 13 | 13 | All chat endpoints (dependency conflicts fixed, API key mode) |
| **Azure OpenAI** (gpt-4.1-mini, East US) | 8 | 8 | All chat endpoints pass (Standard SKU with 1 TPM) |
